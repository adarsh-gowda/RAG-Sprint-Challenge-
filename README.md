# RAG Sprint Challenge â€“ AI Engineering Assignment

## Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for analyzing and comparing financial filings (10-K/Annual reports) of Google, Microsoft, and NVIDIA across 2022, 2023, and 2024.

The system extracts structured insights such as revenue, R&D spending, margins, and other financial metrics, while citing sources with company name, year, excerpt, and page number (if available).

## Features
- Document Parsing: Supports HTML, XHTML, and XML filings (SEC/EDGAR style).
- Chunking & Embedding: Uses LangChain with OpenAIEmbeddings for semantic search.
- RAG Pipeline: Combines retrieval + ChatOpenAI to answer queries grounded in filings.
- Source Attribution: Each answer includes company name, year, excerpt, and page reference.
- Comparison Queries: Handles multi-year, multi-company comparisons (e.g., revenue growth, R&D % of revenue, operating margins).

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- LangChain
- OpenAI API (gpt-4 model)
- BeautifulSoup4 (for document parsing)
- FAISS (vector store for retrieval)
- Pandas (for structured outputs & Excel export)
